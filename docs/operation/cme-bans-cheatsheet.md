# CME main cheat-sheet

This is a simple cheat-sheet if you have doubts about whether a ban
should be included within the main policy list
#community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev (cme-bans).

## Can spam bots be banned? - Yes

Any account which sends messages linking to a suspect external website
or scam is a clear cut ban.

Sometimes accounts will also link to a Matrix room where they will
scam users or sell them garbage. They may not say that explicitly,
sometimes they will just link the alias with a brief
explanation. Often it is best to just ban these accounts outright
rather than investigating.

## Can persistent attackers be banned? - Yes

Sometimes a strong personality will become upset with the moderators
of a community and seek to troll them with throwaway accounts.  They
might join and begin to concern troll, other times they might interact
for awhile, slowly working to drain and undermine the moderators of
the room. Sometimes they will just begin to start abusing the
moderators and lash out.

If the attacker is known to several communities, because there is a
lot of crossover between different communities of the same interest,
then adding these attackers to a list is essential.

Normally persistent attackers create and use their accounts as part of
one incident in one time frame, we defer judgement and trust
moderators of the targeted communities to decide when it is
appropriate to add them to the block-list.

## Can a transphobic user or known bigot be added to the list? - No

If a member of your community is "outed" and it turns out that they
are a bigot or hold hateful views in some way, they cannot be banned
on the block-list. Even if they have immediately retaliated in the same
community by lashing out at other members in the room or the
moderation team.

It might seem clear to you that the user is malicious and hateful.
We cannot add these users to the block-list out of principle, which may
seem absurd and also frustrating.  When we have to make judgement
calls on users like these, we're inviting opportunities to get it
wrong and cause serious harm.

These incidents can easily be misinterpreted or taken out of context,
and adding them to the block-list would severely damage the user's
experience on Matrix and their reputation. We can very easily lock
people out of the entirety of Matrix.

Some of the time these incidents are not clear cut, and it takes time
and consideration from other moderators to decide whether a member
should be sanctioned. This can be done by sharing the report within
the CME Matrix rooms, and individual communities can still decide to
sanction them when they have had time to review the report.

## Can a brigade of users from another community be banned - Yes

Sometimes members of hate-focussed communities will become interested
in your Matrix rooms or your moderation decisions. This could be
in response to a ban, a statement, or any reason really.

Members of the hate-focussed community will then proceed to join with
burner accounts or their main accounts.

They will pretty quickly begin to agitate you about whatever topic of
contention they are upset about currently.  This is brigading and
these accounts can be added directly to the block-list.

## Can accounts spamming images, gore, transphobic comments be banned? - Yes

Sometimes users will join the room and immediately begin to post
abuse. These accounts can always be added directly to the block-list.
