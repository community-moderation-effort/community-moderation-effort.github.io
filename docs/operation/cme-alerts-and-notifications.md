# CME Alerts and notifications

CME has an alerts room
[#cme-alerts-and-notifications:feline.support](https://matrix.to/#/%23cme-alerts-and-notifications%3Afeline.support).
This room is for notifying the entirety of CME about important events.
You will need to join the room to stay informed about what is
happening

Just like the main policy room, anyone can create an alert in this
room. However, there are rules about what can be posted, and you must
consider that we are effectively pinging the entire room. You must
also be considerate as to not saturate the community with alerts, or
make it difficult to scrollback and gather essential information.

Alerts must be as **specific** as possible, properly **edited prior to
sending** with **feedback from others** if possible, and fit on less
than half the typical screen's height.  Alerts must contain a **link
to a message** in the main room
[#moderation:artemislena.eu](https://matrix.to/#/%23moderation%3Aartemislena.eu)
that marks the start of any follow up discussion or questions.

## Exhaustive guidelines

This room is very strictly moderated so that there is
absolutely zero followup discussion or off-topic conversation within it.
The room is strictly for warnings, notifications about important
events, and similar things that are worth bringing to the attention of
everyone in the CME community. Similar to how the CME policy room is
strictly for banning spam and illegal activity, the CME Alerts room
is strictly for:

### Only create relevant notifications

Warning people of harmful or problematic users
that they may wish to ban Informing people of highly significant
community changes being made (i.e., the creation of a new aspect of
the community such as a new room, delegation of mod powers to a new
individual, requests to invite someone to the CME rooms, etc.)  All
other messages, including any discussion related to a message that
falls into one of these two categories, will be immediately deleted
when noticed by any individual with Moderator or higher power level.

Use alerts scarcely if at all possible -
don't make a new notification each time an offending user creates a
new alt account, for instance.

### Keep notifications specific and concise

Notifications MUST: Be very specific in nature (don't just say "Things
are happening, check main for more details") Be entirely on-topic and
worth notifying the entire CME world about - do NOT notify everyone
about projects you're working on or ideas you had. Similarly, do NOT
notify everyone about minor issues such as mildly annoying individuals
or people who you choose to ban but suspect most other people won't
want or need to ban NOT be deleted and recreated. Editing stinks, but
getting pinged multiple times because of someone retrying their
message over and over stinks more.  Consist of at most two Matrix
messages - one text message with all relevant info, and (optionally)
one screenshot. If you need further screenshots, they go in main.  Not
contain screenshots that are larger than 2MiB. Those can be hard for
people to load.

Be as short as possible without omitting needed information. If your
message takes more than half of a widescreen 1080p monitor at 100%
scaling, it's probably too long.  Contain all relevant information
about the alert (what room an event occurred in, the MXID of a
problematic user, a JSON dump of the event in question, etc)

### Allow people to keep track of any following or related discussion

Notifications SHOULD (though not necessarily must):
Contain a link to a "discussion zone" in the main channel. What this
means is that you send a message in main first, get a link to it, and
then copy that link into your alert message. This allows people who
want to discuss to simply click the link, read, and then start typing.
Be as long as needed to convey everything needed in the alert in one
Matrix message. This is not a loophole that allows writing walls of
text. Rather, don't send more than one message per alert.

### Edit if necessary, but avoid if possible

Notifications MUST be edited as much as possible prior to sending.

Notifications MAY be freely edited by the poster at any point in
time. If a notification needs to be updated (because someone's making
new alts or a situation that involves the community is changing in
noticeable ways), just edit it.  Be deleted by the poster or by
moderators if it is believed that the notification is no longer
valuable. For instance if someone notifies about a user that then
turns out to not be an issue, the notification for that user may be
deleted to keep noise to a minimum.
