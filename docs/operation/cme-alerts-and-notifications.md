# CME Alerts

CME has a room for low-noise heads up alerts
[#cme-alerts-and-notifications:feline.support](https://matrix.to/#/%23cme-alerts-and-notifications%3Afeline.support).

### Alerts

This room is for any CME member to create Alerts.
Examples of Alerts might be:
- Warning people of harmful or problematic users that they may wish to
ban
- Reporting accounts associated with spam or brigades
- Any heads-up style message that the rest of the community may be interested in.

### Announcements

Announcements are made to keep CME members informed about
organisational issues. It should be the duty of every member to ensure
that all members are kept informed and up to date.  If an important
topic has been discussed in
[#moderation:artemislena.eu](https://matrix.to/#/%23moderation%3Aartemislena.eu)
that CME members should know about, an alert should be created that
links to the start of the discussion and potentially summarises the
outcome.

Examples of announcements would be for Informing people of highly
significant community changes being made, such as:

- The creation of new CME rooms
- Delegation of mod powers to new individuals
- Requests to invite someone to CME.

Although an announcement could be made for any reason.

### Discussion

All other messages in the alerts room, including any discussion
related to an alert or announcement, must be immediately redacted when
noticed by any individual with the ability to redact them.

### Who can create an alert?

Just like the main policy room, **anyone** can create an alert in this
room. However, there are rules about what can be posted, and you must
consider that we are effectively asking for the attention the entire
room. You must also be considerate as to not saturate the community
with alerts, or make it difficult to scrollback and gather essential
information.

## Alert Checklist

:::tip

If in doubt, make a post in
[#moderation:artemislena.eu](https://matrix.to/#/%23moderation%3Aartemislena.eu)
and an alert can be created afterwards.

:::

To make an alert you should follow the following checklist

- Does the alert contain relevant information?
  - Always include relevant user MXIDs.
  - You may Include JSON source of the event if it is short.
  - Upload at most one screenshot for context, but any more uploads
    should be posted in the main room with the follow up discussion.
  - Don't be vague and say something like "Things are happening -
    check main for details"
- Is the alert short, concise, and specific?
  - It must be possible for the reader to obtain all information to
    assess the alert from reading the alert alone, the reader must not
    be led on to read through layers of conversation to understand all
    relevant information and context.
  - Be as short as possible with omitting necessary information.
	if your message takes up more than half a typical screen then
	it contains too much information.
- Does my alert link to a message in the main room
  [#moderation:artemislena.eu](https://matrix.to/#/%23moderation%3Aartemislena.eu)
  that marks the start of any follow up discussion or questions?
  -  This is not a loophole that allows writing walls of text.  Do not
     send more than one message per alert. Readers need to be kept
     informed without having to read through the main chat.
- Is the alert properly edited, with feedback from others if it is
  an important subject or message?
- Are there other alerts already covering the subject and will
  I sature the alert room (if say there is an ongoing brigade)?
- Is my alert of interest, how do I avoid saturating the room?
  - don't make new alerts each time an offending user creates a new account
  - don't alert CME about projects you are workin on or ideas
  - don't alert CME about minor issues, such as annoying individuals
    or factional politics

## Editing alerts

- You are free to edit your alert once it has been posted at any point
  in time.
- If an alert needs to be updated (because someone's making new alts
  or a situation that involves the community is changing in noticeable
  ways), just edit it.
- An alert may be deleted because it is no longer relevant or there
  has been a mistake.
  - Moderators may remove alerts if they are demed to no longer be
    valuable.  For instance if someone notifies about a user that then
    turns out to not be an issue, the notification for that user may
    be deleted to keep noise to a minimum.
