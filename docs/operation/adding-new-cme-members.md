# Inviting people to join CME

:::info

Anyone being invited to the CME Matrix rooms for any reason must
undergo the same on-boarding process, even when their community has
existing representatives.

This includes asking the room to raise concerns and making sure
everyone is properly informed about what is happening.

It's important to engage with any concern and to come to a compromise
or consensus. Decisions cannot be taken by deciding the complainant or
concern is "outnumbered by vote".

In order to add a new member to CME, the intention for the user to
join must be indicated in the main room, and time should be given for
the existing members to raise thoughts or concerns.

Typically we will need to know some details about the new member

1. Which communities they will be representing.
2. Why they wish to join (if any).

CME works because of positive collaboration between members,
and we need to carefully consider whether new members will disrupt
or change the dynamic within CME.

Examples of concern could be whether the personality has significant
influence in the ecosystem and how that will interact with CME,
whether an existing member has had a bad experience with the new
member which would limit their ability to contribute, whether the new
member is known to be disruptive. There could be any reason.

It's important to engage with the concern and to come to a compromise
or consensus, rather than simply deciding the complainant is
"outnumbered by vote".

Once a member has been invited, they should be on-boarded.

The option for concerns to be raised against any member of CME remains
open the the moderators at any time. But this must not be used to
justify making a rushed decision, bad outcomes have momentum, and can
be difficult to overcome.
