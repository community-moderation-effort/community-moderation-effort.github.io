# Persistent attackers

The persistent attacker is a category of threat actor
that differentiates it self from the commerical spammer by their incentive.

While commercial spammers want money somehow the persistent attacker
has some other motivation unless doing it as mercenary work.

These threat actors show up in a few different categories.

## Help Vampires

The most famous threat actor in matrix moderation history was able to be
put in this category. Their MO was to show up wanting help with a specific problem.

Well they got help a few times but they would show up again and again and again
exact same problem exact same wording. This spam pattern plus constant ban evasion
ends up with making these threat actors eligible for CME main inclusion, especially w
hen they spread to multiple communities.

## Direct Attacks

These threat actors do not care to even make their activities remotely subtle.
Bulk spam of all kinds goes under this category they just join and flood whatever
they prefer to flood with. Plenty of incidents of this category have been documented in matrix history.

## Agitated threat actors

These threat actors are created by someone having agitated them. The exact
situation depends on the threat actor. They are dangerous because they have
a bone to pick. The more damage they do the more enjoyment it causes. Best
advice against these threat actors is to follow the matrix.org playbook and tell your
membership to shut up and deny them a reaction. These threat actors are main
eligible as soon as they are eligible to be classified as spamming or systematic
ban evaders.

## Systematic Ban evaders

These threat actors are in some ways seemingly innocent they might not cause
too much trouble except well they systematically ban evade. Bad examples of this
could have over 20 accounts banned before they give up or more.

## Threat level

Fully dependent on the motivation level of the attacker but it ranges from low-medium
to the maximum threat level possible. Fully dependent on the exact details of the
threat actor.

Its heavily recommended that when you are under attack by one of these category of
threat actor that you get help to supplement your moderation teams capacity or that you
consider the use of partial automation to speed up your time to ban.
