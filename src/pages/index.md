# Welcome to the Community Moderation Effort Website

CME (Community Moderation Effort) is a collective of communities on Matrix.

This project to intertwine moderation in Matrix communities in a way
that is not centralized. The idea is that the members report trolls,
spammers, and hateful users who do not limit their activities to one
community, as well as servers that actively or passively encourage
this behaviour or abuse. There will inevitably be disagreements
regarding particular bans, so room moderators can choose which
reports to act upon.

CME also curates maintains a room, #community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev,
which is used to block blatant spam bots and accounts used as part of
an attack to disrupt conversation in a Matrix room.
We have a dedicated page to describe what kinds of messages or abuse
end up on this policy list that you can read.
